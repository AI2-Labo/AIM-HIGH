        Analyze the provided text with precision and structure.
        ### 1.  Identify Key Concepts:  
        - Extract exactly 10 fundamental key concepts essential to understanding the text.  
        - DO NOT introduce any additional terms beyond those directly discussed in the text.  
        - Ensure that every concept is used in causal relations.  
        
        ### 2. Generate a Structured Summary (Max 600 Words):  
        - Provide a detailed yet concise summary of the document's core ideas.  
        - The summary must naturally include the extracted key concepts and explain their relationships.  
        - Ensure completeness: No cut-off text, and all key principles must be clearly explained.  
        - Avoid unnecessary examples or irrelevant details.  
        
        ### 3. Map Causal Relations (Strictly Using Extracted Key Concepts):  
        - Identify direct cause-and-effect relationships between the extracted key concepts.  
        - DO NOT introduce additional conceptsâ€”only use those from the extracted key concepts list.
        - Each key concept should have at least one causal relationship with another key concept.  
        - Format causal relationships strictly as:  
            - "Concept1 -> Concept2" (A causes B)  
            - "Concept1 <-> Concept2" (Bidirectional relationship)  
        - Ensure 10-15 causal relations that accurately reflect the text.  
        - Reject broad or redundant relationships (e.g., "Motion -> Dynamics" or "Motion <-> Kinematics").  
        - Order them so if a key concept has multiple relations, they are listed together even if the concept is a cause or effect and if it is a effect you can switch the causal relations so it begins with the effect and is <- by the cause.
        
        Format your response as JSON with:
        - 'concepts' as a list of concept names (exactly 10)
        - 'summary' as a string containing the structured summary
        - 'relationships' as a list of objects with 'source', 'target', and 'relationship_type' properties
