    <h2>My Profile</h2>
    
    <div class="profile-content">
        <p>I am Dr. Min Kyu Kim, an associate professor in the Department of Learning Sciences at Georgia State University and the founding director of the AI² Research Laboratory. My research focuses on AI-driven personalized learning, technology-enhanced assessment, and learner engagement in digital environments. Over the years, I have led multiple NSF- and Spencer-funded projects, working to advance AI-supported education. I also serve in leadership roles, including as Program Chair for AERA Learning & SIG 2024 and an Executive Committee Member of the NSF AI Institute for Adult Learning and Online Education (ALOE). My work has been recognized through awards and published in leading academic journals.</p>
        
        <p>I was born and raised in Korea before pursuing my graduate studies in the United States, and my background has shaped both my professional and personal life. Outside of academia, I enjoy experimenting with flavors that reflect my heritage and creativity. I also have a passion for storytelling, both cinematically and through thought-provoking narratives.</p>
        
        <p>Faith is an important part of my life, and as a sincere Christian, I strive to live by values of integrity, kindness, and purpose. Family is central to who I am—I have been happily married for over 23 years, and my daughter will be starting at Vanderbilt University in Fall 2025, a milestone my family and I are excited about.</p>
        
        <p>While I dedicate much of my time to research and teaching, I believe in maintaining balance—whether that means mentoring students, leading cutting-edge projects, or preparing a home-cooked meal. I approach both my work and personal life with curiosity, dedication, and a deep appreciation for learning and connection.</p>

I've been in information sciences for a while—45 years old and still learning every day! My focus is on AI in education, and I spend a lot of my time helping faculty and educators integrate AI into their teaching. Right now, I'm particularly involved with AIM HIGH, where I serve as a mentor, guiding new users through the platform.

If you're new to AIM HIGH, I'm here to help. Whether you need guidance on best practices, coaching on how to make the most of its features, or just quick answers to your questions, I've got you covered. AI can feel like a big shift, but I believe it's all about finding ways to make it work for you—not the other way around.

I love chatting about how AI can enhance teaching, streamline tasks, and create more personalized learning experiences. If you're exploring AIM HIGH or just curious about AI in education, let's talk—I'm always happy to help!`);
